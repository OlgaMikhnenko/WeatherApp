**WeatherApp**

In case I had more time I would:
1. Add coordinators 
    - initial project coordinator instead of having specified builder in AppDelegate
    - features coordinators for future project navigation
2. Increase test coverage
3. Implement different Network layer with support of several endpoints and general solution for Router and Service 
4. Implement safe solution for storing appId
5. Handle network errors and notify user in case of them or if internet connection is lost 
6. Implement skeleton loading model for weather data
7. Add Design System (example of basic structure is implemented in UIComponents package)
    - implement script to extport figma resources (icons, fonts, colors, etc)
    - implement script for creation swift files with extensions for UIImages, UIColors etc based on exported resources
8. Add more information as wind data, visibility, pressure etc
9. Add possibility to check weather in different locations 

I haven't used external dependencies because it's necessary to understand if it's useful for the project based on project technical solutions.
